This folder will contain future development code of a diagnostic desktop application.  This application will list devices in ThermoFlex network, their configurations, and will allow the user to set/reset values, update firmware, and test motion on the controllers.

As Delta develops more peripherals for Robotic and Prosthetic applications, they will be integrated into this client application.
